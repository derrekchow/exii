  title: Automation Accuracy Is Good, but High Controllability May Be Better

  abstract: When automating tasks using some form of artificial intelligence, some
    inaccuracy in the result is virtually unavoidable. In many cases, the user must
    decide whether to try the automated method again, or fix it themselves using the
    available user interface. We argue this decision is influenced by both perceived
    automation accuracy and degree of task "controllability" (how easily and to what
    extent an automated result can be manually modified). This relationship between
    accuracy and controllability is investigated in a 750-participant crowdsourced
    experiment using a controlled, gamified task. With high controllability, self-reported
    satisfaction remained constant even under very low accuracy conditions, and overall,
    a strong preference was observed for using manual control rather than automation,
    despite much slower performance and regardless of very poor controllability.

  title: Rig Animation with a Tangible and Modular Input Device
  issue_date: July 2016
  publisher: Association for Computing Machinery
  publisher-place: New York, NY, USA
  volume: '35'
  issue: '4'
  issn: 0730-0301

  abstract: We propose a novel approach to digital character animation, combining
    the benefits of tangible input devices and sophisticated rig animation algorithms.
    A symbiotic software and hardware approach facilitates the animation process for
    novice and expert users alike. We overcome limitations inherent to all previous
    tangible devices by allowing users to directly control complex rigs using only
    a small set (5-10) of physical controls. This avoids oversimplification of the
    pose space and excessively bulky device configurations. Our algorithm derives
    a small device configuration from complex character rigs, often containing hundreds
    of degrees of freedom, and a set of sparse sample poses. Importantly, only the
    most influential degrees of freedom are controlled directly, yet detailed motion
    is preserved based on a pose interpolation technique. We designed a modular collection
    of joints and splitters, which can be assembled to represent a wide variety of
    skeletons. Each joint piece combines a universal joint and two twisting elements,
    allowing to accurately sense its configuration. The mechanical design provides
    a smooth inverse kinematics-like user experience and is not prone to gimbal locking.
    We integrate our method with the professional 3D software Autodesk Maya® and discuss
    a variety of results created with characters available online. Comparative user
    experiments show significant improvements over the closest state-of-the-art in
    terms of accuracy and time in a keyframe posing task.
