# Visual/Brand Designer Role

Interhouse is an inter-university collective whose purpose is to foster and support collaboration between artists, designers, and engineers. We facilitate experimental projects that focus on the intersection of art and technology.

**This role would be as the sole visual/brand designer from now until at least September 2020.**
<br/><br/>
## What would you do?
- Create a visual identity and language for the organization
- Create a org brand and maintain its consistency
- All branding: logo, style guide, graphics, etc
- All visuals such as posters, social media assets, forms, documents, signage (all digital)
- Involved in the creative direction of the org

<br/>
## This might be for you if you want...
- To bring together skilled students from different disciplines
- To create unique work that will reach a wide range of students in North America
- A creative challenge that will expand your work, skills, and areas of knowledge
- Play a major role in a new type of student org

<br/>
## You might be a good fit if you...
- Have experience and a background in visual/graphic/branding design (or equivalent)
- Have worked in high-caliber teams
- Are organized, can meet deadlines and consistently deliver

<br/>
Whats unique about this opportunity is that this org is the first of its kind and focused on experimentation, creativity, and risk-taking which would be reflected in the visual identity of the org. We have some really cool visuals to work with that combine art and tech.
